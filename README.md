# react-ssr-boilerplate
Simple boilerplate for React Server-Side rendering

# Minimal amount of talk, optimized amount of code
I'm not here to launch Falcon Heavy into space, I just want to render my components from backend.

# Consist of

- **Restify.js** â€“ because Express.js is too mainstream;
- **Babel and stuff** - to compile your JSX;
- **Webpack and fellow loaders** - to bundle your stuff properly;
- **React and ReactDOM** - would be (not) funny not to include that;
- **isomorphic-fetch** - sneaky little fella to fetch everything everywhere.

# How to run this
```sh
$ cd react-ssr-boilerplate/
$ npm i
$ npm start
$ npm serve
```
